These are my solutions for some of these coding challenges in Go:

### **NOTE:**

The goal is to preserve each solution close to state as I first submitted the right answers. So I'll keep refactoring and cleanup to a minimum.

I think this way it will be more interesting to look back on these in the future and think about the initial thought process and how rough some first iterations can be.
If in the future I decide to refactor the solutions, the updated ones will be under separate files/packages clearly indicating the difference.
